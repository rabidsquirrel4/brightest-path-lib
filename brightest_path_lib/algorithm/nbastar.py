"""The New Bidirectional A* Search Algorithm is an improvement over the
original Bidirectional A* Search algorithm, which is a variation of the
A* Search algorithm that searches from both the start and goal nodes 
simultaneously in order to find the shortest path more efficiently.

The New Bidirectional A* Search Algorithm was proposed to address a 
limitation of the original Bidirectional A* Search algorithm, which is 
that it often expands too many nodes and wastes computational resources. 
The new algorithm works by using two heuristic functions, one for the 
forward search and one for the backward search, and dynamically
adjusting them during the search.

The algorithm starts with two search trees, one rooted at the start node
and one rooted at the goal node. The forward search tree expands nodes 
in the direction of the goal node, and the backward search tree expands 
nodes in the direction of the start node. The search terminates when the
two trees meet in the middle, i.e., when they have a common node. 

During the search, the heuristic functions are dynamically adjusted
based on the cost of the path found so far. If the cost of the path
found so far is greater than the estimated cost of the path from the 
start node to the goal node, the heuristic function for the forward 
search is increased, and if the cost is less than the estimated cost, 
the heuristic function is decreased. The same adjustments are made 
to the heuristic function for the backward search.

This dynamic adjustment of the heuristic functions helps to reduce the
number of nodes expanded during the search and improve the efficiency
of the algorithm.

To search for the brightest path between two points in an image:

1. Initialize the NBAStarSearch class with the 2D/3D image,
   start point and the goal point: `nbastar = NBAStarSearch(image, start_point, goal_point)`
2. Call the search method: `path = nbastar.search()`
