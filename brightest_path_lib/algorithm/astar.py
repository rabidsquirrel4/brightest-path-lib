# algorithm/astar.py

"""This implementation of the A* search algorithm finds the brightest path
in a graph. Each node in the graph represents a point in space, and the
weight of each edge represents the brightness of the path between the two nodes. 
The goal is to find the path that maximizes the total brightness.
     
To use the A* search algorithm for brightest path finding, a heuristic 
function is needed that estimates the maximum brightness that can be 
achieved from the current node to the goal node. One way to do this 
is to use a greedy heuristic that always selects the edge with the
highest brightness from the current node. 

The A* search algorithm starts at the start node and explores
neighboring nodes, selecting the node with the highest brightness
at each step. The algorithm uses the heuristic function to estimate
the maximum brightness that can be achieved from the current node to
the goal node. If the algorithm reaches the goal node, it terminates
and returns the brightest path. If not, it continues searching until
all nodes have been explored.

To search for the brightest path between two points in an image:

1. Initialize the AStarSearch class with the 2D/3D image,
   start point and the goal point: `astar = AStarSearch(image, start_point, goal_point)`
2. Call the search method: `path = astar.search()`
